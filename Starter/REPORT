CSC 418 - Assignment 1 Report File

In this file you must:

__________________________________________________________________
1) Describe *briefly* and *concisely* what parts of the assignment
   you found easier, harder, and/or tricky to get right

Adding the controllers for each rule was easier since an example was 
already given. Harder parts of the assignment was drawing the boids, 
and the tricky parts were figuring out how to apply the given pseudocode
into rule 1, 2, and 3.

__________________________________________________________________
2) Answer any //QUESTION: items noted in the code

Is this the optimal way to implement this rule? can you see any 
problems or ways to improve this bit?

This is not the optimal way to implement the rule, since each boid
has to iterate through the other boids. This can cause a longer 
program runtime. The runtime would improve if there was a different
way to calculate the center of mass without having to use a loop
for each boid.


Why add inertia at the end and not at the beginning?

If we add inertia in the beginning, then the rules would be applied 
to the inertia velocity instead of boid velocity.

3) Describe any //CRUNCHY: extensions you implemented

4) Briefly comment on the following:

a) What is the time complexity of the boid update (in big Oh notation),
   justify.

The time complexity is big O(n^2) since for each boid we are iterating 
over all the boids.

b) What could you do to make the update more efficient?

We can create a data structure that can track which boids are in the 
distance of the current boid. 

c) What is the greatest bottleneck of the program:

    Is it the boid update code?
    Or is it the boid display code?

    Why is that? justify your answer.

Boid update is the greatest bottleneck of the program because the 
function needs O(n^2) time to run, while each draw transformation 
takes a constant time to run.

d) How would you adapt the idea behind Boids to swarms of running
   creatures (e.g. a herd of charging animals, an army of CGI
   monsters, a crowd of simulated humans walking). Think of the
   specific conditions you would need to add to the simulation
   that are different from your Boids implementation

Our current boids move while floating. Ie. there is no gravity and
movement is similar to flying in the air or swimming in water. For 
running creatures, we would have to modify the boids to move on a 
surface with gravity applied down to them.
